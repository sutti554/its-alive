    <title>A Pattern Language</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE <br>

        A pattern language has the structure of a network. This is explained fully in The Timeless Way of Building. However, when we use the network of a language, we always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller, always from the ones which create structures, to the ones which then embellish those structures, and then to those which embellish the embellishments. . . . <br>
        Since the language is in truth a network, there is no one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the sequence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down, dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little like a needle following a tapestry. <br>
        The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns. If you read through the sentences which connect the groups of patterns to one another, you will get an overview of the whole language. And once you get this overview, you will then be able to find the patterns which are relevant to your own project. <br>
        And finally, as we shall explain in the next section, this sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from which you can make a language for your own project, by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,and leaving them more or less in the order that you find them printed here. <br>
        
        <p>
            We begin with that part of the language which defines a town or community. These patterns can never be “designed” or “built” in one fell swoop—but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it. <br>

            1. INDEPENDENT REGIONS <br>

            within each region work toward those regional policies
            which will protect the land and mark the limits of the
            cities; <br>

            build up these larger city patterns from the grass roots,
            through action essentially controlled by two levels of
            self-governing communities, which exist as physically
            identifiable places; <br>

            <p>
                    This completes the global patterns which define a
                    town or a community. We now start that part of the
                    language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and
                    individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions.
                    These are the patterns which can be “designed” or
                    “built”—the patterns which define the individual build-
                    ings and the space between buildings; where we are deal-
                    ing for the first time with patterns that are under the
                    control of individuals or small groups of individuals,
                    who are able to build the patterns all at once. <br>
                    
                    The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall
                    arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and
                    number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main
                    parking areas, and lines of movement through the complex; <br>

                    fix the position of individual buildings on the site, within
                    the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the
                    site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important
                    moments in the language, <br>

                    109. LONG THIN HOUSE <br>

                    within the buildings’ wings, lay out the entrances, the
                    gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the
                    volume of the buildings and the volume of the space between the buildings at the same time—remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang, must always get their shape together; <br>

                    when the major parts of buildings and the outdoor areas
                    have been given their rough shape, it is the right time to
                    give more detailed attention to the paths and squares
                    between the buildings; <br>

                    right, and making human details there; <br>

                <p>
                        At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual building. If you have followed the patterns
                        given, you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on
                        the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid out. <br>
                        The next, and last part of the language, tells how to
                        make a buildable building directly from this rough
                        scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail. <br>
                        Before you lay out structural details, establish a
                        philosophy of structure which will let the structure grow directly from your plans and your conception of the
                        buildings; <br>

                        208. GRADUAL STIFFENING <br>

                        within this philosophy of structure, on the basis of the
                        plans which you have made, work out the complete
                        structural layout; this is the last thing you do on paper, before you actually start to build; <br>

                        213. FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION <br>

                        put stakes in the ground to mark the columns on the site, and start erecting the main frame of the building according to the layout of these stakes, <br>

                        within the main frame of the building, fix the exact positions for openings—the doors and windows—and frame
